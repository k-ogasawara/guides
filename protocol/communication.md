# Communication

A guide for communicating within ookami.

## GitHub

- We use GitHub as a communication tool.
- Post on GitHub after you talk something over face to face.
- Two weeks sprint.

### Issues (Tickets)

- People assign themselves to tickets. When in doubt, do not assign a ticket to someone.

## ZenHub

- We are scrum team.
- Our board contains:
  - New Issues
  - Priority Box (To Do with Priority)
  - In Progress
  - Check (Need to be checked to be done or closed)

## Slack

- Casual communication tool.
- If it seems important, post the contents on GitHub.
- You need to join following channels:
  - `#general`
  - `#development`
- Administrators of live and push need to join:
  - `#live-admin`
  - `#push-admin`
- We also have these channels:
  - `#ios-review` (Review Monitor by LaunchKit)
  - `#lunch` (Lunch notifications)
  - `#peropero` (Just for Daily Chatting)
  - `#share` (Something useful)
  - `#times-yourname` (Your personal channel for logging your activities)
  - `#zenhub` (Zenhub board activities)

## Google Apps

- Documents something secure.
- Paste links to the documents on GitHub for easy access.
- Use Excel if it would be better to use table calculation instead of posting texts on GitHub.
